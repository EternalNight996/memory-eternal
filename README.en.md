## 🚀 Get Started in 5 Minutes

### 🟦 DeepSeek Harness (DSH) — focus

**Install** (dsh-desktop via DSH CLI, one command):

```bash
# dsh-desktop (recommended): install via DSH CLI into the profile
dsh plugin --profile web add memory-eternal

# or update directly in the profile (pnpm workspace). Use pnpm — `npm install` throws EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL
cd ~/.dsh/profiles/web && pnpm add memory-eternal@latest

# right after a release, @latest can be held back by pnpm's minimum-release-age gate or a cached
# packument (it silently stays on the old version): pin the version instead — pnpm adds it to the
# workspace's minimumReleaseAgeExclude automatically
cd ~/.dsh/profiles/web && pnpm add memory-eternal@0.9.0

# verify the version, then restart dsh web
node -e "console.log(require('memory-eternal/package.json').version)"
```

After **restarting dsh web**, three things are live immediately:

| Effect | Where |
|---|---|
| Auto-capture of knowledge cards | Happens every turn, no action needed |
| `memory_recall` tool | Agent calls it automatically when it needs history |
| Visual UI | Sidebar bottom `Memory` button / Settings → Memory |

**Entry**: The sidebar-footer `Memory` button opens the vault (its left rail includes Cards / Graph / Usage / **Audit Center** / Recycle Bin / **Memory Config**); "DSH Settings → Memory" is the pure config page.

**UI language**: The whole UI is bilingual (English / 中文) and follows **DSH Settings → Language** in real time — Cards, Graph, Audit Center, card templates, config panel all included; the standalone web page follows the browser language.

**Edit config**: Vault left rail "Memory Config" (or DSH Settings → Memory) → DSH memory config / cost control / auto-audit config / self-hosting — just hit "Save Config". `autoWebMode` / `watchdogAutoSpawn` changes require a DSH restart.

### 🟨 Claude Code

```bash
npm i -g memory-eternal     # installs CLI + MCP (auto-writes ~/.claude.json + SessionEnd hook)
```

Ready after install: say "recall 数据库选型" in a session → auto-retrieves memory; on session end / before context compaction → auto-captures.

### 🟧 Codex CLI / Cursor

```bash
npm i -g memory-eternal     # auto-writes Codex config.toml / Cursor mcp.json
```

Restart the tool → MCP is in the list; just use: `用 memory_recall 查一下项目历史决策`.

### 🟩 Browser (no Agent needed)

```bash
dsh-memory open    # starts web + opens browser (default http://127.0.0.1:7999)
```

Stats / search / card grid (add-edit-merge-import-export) / knowledge graph — all here. Same UI as the DSH embed; data stays in sync.

> **zcode (Zhipu)**: no native MCP; bridge via [zcode-open-bridge](https://github.com/tizerluo/zcode-open-bridge) or use the CLI directly.

---

## 📖 Command Reference

```bash
dsh-memory recall "database selection"   # retrieve
dsh-memory capture "important note..."   # manual capture (- reads stdin)
dsh-memory sweep ~/.claude/projects      # mine existing sessions
dsh-memory setup [--dry-run]             # re-run / preview auto-mount (idempotent)
dsh-memory mcp                           # MCP stdio (mount to any MCP client)
dsh-memory serve [--port 7999]           # run web in foreground
dsh-memory open                          # ensure web alive + open browser
dsh-memory watchdog [--port 7799]        # watchdog keep-alive (standalone process)
```

When not running on DSH, the `dsh-memory` command comes from `npm i -g`.

## ⚙️ Self-hosting (plain words)

Three concepts, don't mix them:

- **How the web server stays alive** (`autoWebMode`) → `init`=pull once at DSH start (default); `interval`=DSH in-process timer probes & auto-restarts (0 extra memory); `manual`=fully manual, only from `dsh-memory open`.
- **Watchdog process** (`watchdogAutoSpawn`, default on) → a **standalone** node process that can pull web up even after DSH exits (~+47 MB RAM). Only turn on for 7×24 keep-alive.
- **Auto-mount MCP** (`autoMcpSetup`, default off) → whether to auto-write MCP into Claude Code/Codex/Cursor config. Off = don't touch your machine config; run `dsh-memory setup` manually when needed.

**Change these**: Vault left rail "Memory Config" (or DSH Settings → Memory) → edit the table and save; `autoWebMode` / `watchdogAutoSpawn` need a DSH restart.

**MCP is a protocol, not a resident service**: the agent spawns it per session and exits when done — no "auto-start on boot" concept.

### Three deployment intensities

| Scenario | Config | Memory |
|---|---|---|
| Personal dev (default) | `autoWebMode=init` + `watchdogAutoSpawn=off` | web 47 MB |
| Resident 7×24 | `watchdogAutoSpawn=on` | web + watchdog 47+47 MB |
| True boot auto-start (no DSH) | Windows Task Scheduler runs `dsh-memory watchdog --port 7799 --interval 5000 --max-restart 10` | same |

---

## ⚙️ Memory Config (plain words)

> All settings live in the **vault left rail "Memory Config"** (or DSH Settings → Memory) — edit and hit "Save". Here's the full page (plugin info / Agent MCP mount status / auto-audit config):

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EternalNight996/memory-eternal/main/assets/screen/memory-config.png" width="880" alt="Memory config page" />
</p>

### 1. Most used

| Setting | Default | In plain words |
|---|---|---|
| Auto capture | on | auto-store useful content as cards after each turn |
| Auto recall | on | AI auto-queries memory when it needs history |
| Vault dir | `~/.dsh/memory-vault` | where memory lives, plain Markdown & git-able |

### 2. Save money (important)

| Setting | Default | In plain words |
|---|---|---|
| **Distill cards** | on | **compress** a conversation into a sharp card (calls AI, costs money). **Off = store raw text, zero cost** |
| **Dedup feeds AI** | on | judge if new content is a duplicate (calls AI). **Off = simple dedup**, saves one AI call |
| Distill output cap | 900 | max chars per compress, bigger = sharper but pricier |
| Recall min score | 2 | how "close" a match must be to return; bigger = sharper but leaks more (cheaper) |
| Min capture chars | 200 | too-short chats aren't stored (avoids small-talk waste) |
| Daily quota | 60 | max cards per day, prevents AI burning money |

### 3. How the service runs

| Setting | Default | In plain words |
|---|---|---|
| Keep-alive `autoWebMode` | init | `init`=open web once at DSH start; `interval`=periodically check & restart if dead; `manual`=fully manual |
| Watchdog `watchdogAutoSpawn` | on | a **standalone process** keeps web alive (+47 MB). Personal use can turn off |
| Auto-mount MCP `autoMcpSetup` | off | **lets Claude Code / Codex / Cursor use your memory**. On = auto-configures them; Off = never touches your config, run `dsh-memory setup` manually |

> 💰 **To save money**: turn `Distill cards` off, lower `Distill output cap`, raise `Recall min score`.

### 🎯 One-click presets

Top of the config page: **🟢 A Light / 💰 B Budget / ⭐ C Premium** — click to fill, then Save:

| Plan | Scenario | Keep-alive | Watchdog | Distill | Distill cap | Recall min | Memory | LLM cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🟢 **A Light** | Personal dev (default) | init | off | on | 900 | 2 | ~47 MB | normal |
| 💰 **B Budget** | Tight budget / many Agents | init | off | **off** | 500 | 3 | ~47 MB | **~0** |
| ⭐ **C Premium** | Long projects / teams | interval | **on** | on | 1200 | 1 | ~94 MB | high |

## 🔔 Capture Log & Failure Alerts

Auto-capture is a silent background pipeline: when it broke, the only symptom used to be "no new cards" with no visible cause. Since v0.9.0 it speaks up.

- **Capture log**: Settings → Memory → Usage / Today shows the last 100 run entries: `🚀 boot` / `👂 session attached (which event API + event count)` / `✅ card created` / `➕ update appended` / `⏭ skipped (reason)` / `❌ failed (reason)`.
- **Active alerts**: any failure turns the strip red at the top of the memory library *and* injects "auto-capture failed + reason" into the agent context, so the agent tells you in its first sentence — no need to dig through logs.
- **Stall watchdog**: if turns start but no turn-stopping event arrives for 15 minutes (e.g. DSH renamed the event), a 10-minute sweep reports it.
- **Self-adapting event API**: the session event API is detected automatically (`ownEvents()` → `snapshotEvents()` → `events`), so a DSH upgrade that changes the API can no longer silently break capture.

---

## 🛡️ Audit Center & Recycle Bin

> **Agents cannot approve on your behalf (since v0.9.1).** Whenever audit is active, the plugin injects a red line into the agent context: new cards stay `pending`, and calling the `approve`/`reject` endpoints (or any equivalent bypass) is forbidden. The decision is always yours.

New cards go to the **Audit Center** (`pending`) by default and enter the main vault only after you approve them; rejected ones move to "Rejected", where you can restore or delete to the recycle bin. Cards matching an exemption (audit mode = skip all / exempt agents / exempt kinds) go straight in; recycle-bin cards are recoverable within 30 days, then auto-purged.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EternalNight996/memory-eternal/main/assets/screen/audit-center.png" width="880" alt="Audit Center" />
</p>

- **Pending / Rejected** tabs, filtered by type / date / agent; select all and approve / reject / delete-to-recycle in one click.
- Rules in "Memory Config → Auto-audit config": `audit mode` (audit all / skip all) + `exempt agents` + `exempt kinds` + `recycle retention days`.

### 🥇 Why the audit system is more reliable (vs other memory products)

Most memory products (mem0 / Zep / agentmemory…) auto-ingest **everything** the moment a conversation ends, good or bad — noise, wrong facts, and sensitive content all go in and get recalled later, **polluting context and amplifying hallucinations**.

memory-eternal uses **human-in-the-loop auditing** — only trusted content enters the main vault:

| Dimension | Other memory products | memory-eternal audit system |
|---|---|---|
| Ingest | Auto-ingest all, no gate | New cards first enter the **Audit Center (`pending`)**, approved before entering the vault |
| Quality | No filtering of noise/errors | Only cards you've confirmed → more accurate recall, less noise |
| Traceability | No source/audit trail | Every card carries `submittedBy` author + `pending/approved/rejected` state |
| No-friction | — | Exempt agents / exempt kinds hit → trusted cards go straight in, zero wait |
| Safety | Delete = gone forever | Recycle-bin soft delete, recoverable within 30 days |

---

## 🧬 Why Fully Self-built

Most memory solutions lean on third-party frameworks / spin up an MCP service / lock memory in a private store. This plugin builds the skeleton itself — **zero third-party runtime deps**, logic readable line by line:

| Module | Self-built | Replaces |
|---|---|---|
| Dedup | lexical Jaccard bigram (0.62) + semantic dedup | duplicate-card prevention |
| Retrieval | CJK-aware: Chinese whole-word + char bigram | no full-text search engine needed |
| Graph | force-directed + `[[wikilink]]`/shared-tag edges | see knowledge links at a glance |
| Storage | plain `.md` with frontmatter | not locked in, readable, git-able, any tool can read |

> Same direction as popular projects (summarize→store→recall), but positioned differently: **local, self-built, zero-dep, readable & controllable**. If you already use mem0/Zep etc., just layer this as a "local persistent memory base".

## 📋 Changelog

> **Withdrawn versions**: **v0.9.0 – v0.9.5 are all deprecated on npm, and the release tags for v0.9.1 / v0.9.2 / v0.9.3 / v0.9.4 have been removed from git** (v0.9.5 is merely superseded, so its tag stays) — v0.9.1/v0.9.2 ship the blank-memory-page defect, v0.9.0 false-alarms its capture warnings, v0.9.3 does not support DSH v0.1.7-rc.2 (the plugin stops mounting entirely: the settings service changed and the client-side `settingsScope` is gone), v0.9.4 crashes under the official desktop build (schemastery 3.18.4 volatile live references) with `cfg.vaultDir.trim is not a function`, and **v0.9.5's full-screen overlay covers the desktop shell's window controls (its top-right "×" sits on the window Close button — one click quits the whole shell)**. Use **v0.9.6+** (`npm i memory-eternal@latest`).

> **DSH compatibility**: `>=0.1.5-alpha.2 <0.2.0`. **v0.9.4 adds support for DSH v0.1.7-rc.2**, which replaced the settings service with a forms-only API and removed `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-runtime` / `settingsScope`; **v0.9.5 adds support for schemastery ≥3.18.4 volatile live references** (the shape the official desktop profile uses, while the web profile still ships 3.18.1 — both work); **v0.9.6 keeps full-screen overlays clear of the desktop shell's window controls**. The 0.1.5 line still uses the legacy `settings.register` path; both paths are kept.

| Version | Date | Highlights |
|---|---|---|
| **v0.9.6** | 2026-09-28 | **Fixed the full-screen overlay covering the desktop shell's window controls (clicking Close quit the whole shell)**: the desktop shell draws minimize / maximize / close at the top of the page and, per the DSH convention, marks `<html>` with `data-windows-titlebar` and publishes `--dsh-windows-titlebar-height` (both confirmed present inside the official desktop build's `app.asar`); the memory overlay used `inset:0` plus an inline `100vh`, covering that whole strip, and our own top-right "×" landed exactly on the shell's window Close — one click quit the entire desktop shell. The full-screen state now uses the `.me-modal-full` class (no inline `100vh`, which CSS cannot override), and under `[data-windows-titlebar]` the `.me-overlay-top` / `.me-overlay` / `.me-modal-full` surfaces are pushed down by `--dsh-windows-titlebar-height` with height `calc(100vh - that)`. Browsers without the attribute get a 0px offset, so behaviour is unchanged there. The export-graph full-screen preview also moved from `100vh` to `100%` so it cannot overflow the shortened overlay. Adds 1 render regression asserting all three avoidance rules ship in the bundle |
| **v0.9.5** | 2026-09-28 | **Fixed the plugin failing to mount under the official desktop build (schemastery 3.18.4)**: the desktop profile resolves **schemastery 3.18.4**, which turns every `volatile` Config field into a cosmokit **live reference** (`{ get(): snapshot }` branded with `Symbol.for('cosmokit.volatile.write')`), while 0.9.4 treated those fields as plain values — `cfg.vaultDir.trim()` threw `TypeError: cfg.vaultDir.trim is not a function` and the plugin died inside `apply` (the exact desktop error). The plugin now **deep-unwraps** references per the cosmokit protocol (snapshot each reference, recurse through arrays/objects), so `settings.get()` only ever exposes plain values; each read unwraps afresh, so in-place volatile hot updates stay immediately visible, and `JSON.stringify` no longer writes `{}` into the shared config file. Adds 2 regressions (the real 3.18.4 reference shape + nested arrays/objects) and verifies `apply` under the **desktop build's real module-resolution layout** (schemastery 3.18.4 + real cosmokit) |
| **v0.9.4** | 2026-09-28 | **DSH v0.1.7-rc.2 support (fixes "the plugin goes dark after the upgrade")**: (1) **The settings service was replaced** — in 0.1.7 `ctx.settings` is a forms-only API (`describe/update/replace/mutate/configure`) with no `register()`; the old `ctx.settings.register(...)` call throws a `TypeError`, so the plugin never mounts (memory page gone, auto-capture dead). A cross-version shim keeps `register` for older hosts while new hosts read the **live config reference** the loader passes in, subscribe to `loader/volatile-update` for hot updates, and write back through `settings.update(entry id, patch, revision)` (revision conflicts map to HTTP 409); it also registers `configure({ auto:false })` so the host does not generate a duplicate form page. (2) **Volatile field marking moved after construction**: no more chained `.volatile()` — that method only exists in schemastery ≥3.18.4, while the plugin actually resolves **3.18.1** at the profile level, so the chain threw `volatile is not a function` at import time and killed the plugin. (3) **Dead client references removed**: `inject` no longer lists `settingsScope`, which disappeared together with `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-runtime` (0.1.7 has no such service, so the client plugin waited forever and never activated — taking the memory page and the sidebar button with it); `dsh.client.inject` dropped its non-existent package names. (4) New **`tests/settings-compat.test.mjs`** (8 cases: 0.1.7-shaped mount / live-reference reads / volatile hot update / write-back and revision conflict / legacy `register` path / field volatile markers) wired into `npm test`. Verified by booting a **real DSH v0.1.7-rc.2**: the host plugin mounts (config written to `memory-eternal-config.json`) and the client bundle composes into the boot graph (`plugins/??memory-eternal/client.js`) |
| **v0.9.3** | 2026-09-12 | **Fixed the blank memory page ("no UI")**: v0.9.1 placed the infinite-scroll `useEffect` **before** the `loadCards` definition — React evaluates the dependency array during render, hitting a TDZ error (`Cannot access 'loadCards' before initialization`) that **crashed the whole memory page on first render**. It now comes after the definition. Added a **render smoke test** (`tests/ssr.test.mjs`: renders the built bundle through all four entry points — cards / settings / usage / graph — wired into `npm test`) so "green build, blank page" bugs cannot ship again |
| **v0.9.2** | 2026-09-12 | **Log visibility + false-alarm fix**: the capture log is now **persisted to disk** (`~/.dsh/memory-eternal-capture.jsonl`, last 500 entries) — the standalone web page no longer says "log only available inside the DSH host" but shows the records, and history survives a host restart (read back on boot); fixed **stall-detector false alarms flooding the panel** (mismatched turn counters are normal: sub-agent turns and cancelled turns emit no `turn-stopping`; it now requires "turns running **and** no capture activity for 15 minutes" to alert once, and the alarm clears as soon as activity resumes — no more one `fail` line every 10 minutes permanently turning health red); when distillation returns nothing / unparseable JSON the content is **saved as a raw card instead of being dropped** |
| **v0.9.1** | 2026-09-12 | **Performance & UX batch**: memory page loads lazily per view (opening Settings no longer drags in 250KB of cards + 890KB of graph; first paint needs ~0.5KB); graph generation **3232ms → 43ms** (bigram sets computed once + lossless mathematical-bound pruning + tag inverted index) plus a server-side cache with **fingerprint invalidation** (write/audit/delete rebuilds immediately, no stale reads); site-wide **brotli q5** (graph 877KB → **54KB**, 34% smaller than gzip; cards 246KB → 83KB → 20KB with br) and large responses compressed with both br and gzip keeping the smaller, so no response is ever worse than gzip; `/cards` gained **real pagination** (offset/limit/total + server-side title sort, globally ordered across pages) loading 100 cards first and fetching more on scroll; the "Agent cards" panel in Usage/Today filters by agent server-side (30 rows); **audit red line**: the plugin injects "never call approve/reject on the user's behalf" into the agent context; the watchdog now **reaps redundant instances on fallback ports** (a duplicate web process holding 76MB was reaped in testing) |
| **v0.9.0** | 2026-09-12 | **Fixed silent auto-capture death (6 days without a single card)**: after a DSH upgrade the session event API moved from `events` to `ownEvents()/snapshotEvents()`; the listener read nothing, returned silently and left no trace — now it tries `ownEvents()` → `snapshotEvents()` → `events` and logs a per-session attach entry. Daily quota now counts **real writes only** (previously every "not worth saving" verdict burned quota, exhausting the 24h budget after 40 attempts); `captureCooldownMs` actually applies; a single capture input is tail-capped at 20k chars. New **capture log** panel and **active failure alerts** (red strip + agent-context injection + turn-stopping stall sweep). Removed the automatic "Daily review" digest (timer / `/todayBrief` route / UI button). |
| **v0.8.0** | 2026-09-06 | **Full UI i18n**: follows the DSH system language live (zh/en) across cards, graph, audit center, config panel and new-card templates; SQLite EBUSY fix for the Windows test suite |
| **v0.3.1** | 2026-09-03 | Knowledge graph loads on demand (fetch on open, unregister on close) |
| **v0.3.0** | 2026-09-03 | **SQLite storage layer** (`node:sqlite`, zero deps) + DB-level audit guard `enforceAudit()` + `audit_log` table + automatic `.md` migration |
| v0.2.0 | 2026-09-03 | Recall with body text (`search()` returns the `excerpt` field) |
| v0.1.2 | 2026-09-03 | Audit guard hardening (`writeCard` defaults to `pending`, `mergeCards` goes through audit) |
| v0.1.1 | 2026-09-03 | Recall body fix (`excerpt` field + body logic) |
| v0.1.0 | 2026-08-31 | First release: auto capture + auto recall + graphical knowledge base + knowledge graph + audit center + recycle bin |
